Message format (from view of A):

{
    "nonce":"adkfhkjhjkJKHJKhjkahdfjksad", // <-- for ID purpose
    "pending":[
        "D",
        "E"
    ],
    "remove":{
        "identification":"random_unique_hash", // <-- important since this protects against deleting same named files for example
        // either remove file or remove peer
    }
}


HOW TO:
 - A knows that BCDE need update
 - BC connect
 - A sends BC update
 - BC apply
 - A knows that DE need update
 - A sends to BC that DE need update
 - A offline
 
 - D connects
 - BC send update
 - D apply
 - BC know that E needs update
 - BC sends to D that E needs update
 - BC offline
 
 - E connects
 - D sends E update
 - E apply
 - DE done
 
 - A connects
 - A sends DE update
 - DE do nothing (nonce already known OR no such file exists)
 - A done
 
 - BC connect
 - BC sends E update
 - E does nothing
 - BC done
 
^^ nonce in update ensures that update is only executed once for every peers
repeated receive is no problem --> ignored if file doesn't exist anyway
the above can be combined: here is the update and the following people still don't know of it
