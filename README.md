My master thesis LaTeX document.
The thesis proposes and will discribe the implementation of a peer to peer file synchronization tool based on the Tox messenger protocol.
Implementation language will be Golang.
The intention is to design and implement a protocol that works via Tox and implement at least two clients for it (user client and server client for third party support).
