\section*{Gratitude}
\label{chap:gratitude}

First and foremost my thanks go out to my support network, both from my university and my personal one.
Marc Schickler for offering encouragement and praise when things worked.
My friends for regularly asking how I was doing, thus building up sufficient pressure to keep working continuously so as not to disappoint them.
My extended family for all the ohs and ahs whenever I tried to explain something to them.

This work stands on the shoulders of giants.
Therefore our heartfelt thanks go out first and foremost to the open source community that made building this thesis a possibility: Tox for providing a peer to peer fully encrypted communication channel; Hadoop for providing a solution for saving many user's files in a sane method; and Golang for the access to source code when things didn't work as expected.
Special thanks to the Github user Codedust for his support whenever I had self inflicted problems with his Golang Tox wrapper.

TODO: Correct, improve, add.
