\section*{Gratitude}
\label{chap:gratitude}

My thanks go out to my support network, both from my university and my personal one.
My supervisor Marc Schickler for offering encouragement and praise when things worked.
My friends for regularly asking how I was doing, thus building up sufficient pressure to keep working continuously so as not to disappoint them.
My extended family for the many nice questions about what I was doing and sitting through the long explanations with sufficient interest to keep me going.

TODO: the people who'll proof read this thesis will be mentioned by name here.

This work would not have been possible without the great tools and libraries and the many people that implemented and documented them.
Therefore my heartfelt thanks go out first and foremost to the open source community that made building this thesis a possibility: Tox for providing a peer to peer fully encrypted communication channel and Golang for the access to source code when things didn't work as expected.
Worthy of special mention is the Github user Codedust for maintaining the Golang Tox wrapper on which I built this thesis.
Special thanks are due for their support whenever I had problems or feature requests and always received help and support.
