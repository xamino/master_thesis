\section*{Gratitude}
\label{chap:gratitude}

This work stands on the shoulders of giants.
Therefore our heartfelt thanks go out first and foremost to the open source community that made building this thesis a possibility: Tox for providing a peer to peer fully encrypted communication channel; Hadoop for providing a solution for saving many user's files in a sane method; and Golang for the access to source code when things didn't work as expected.

TODO: Correct, improve, add.
