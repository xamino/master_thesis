\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

This chapter serves as the conclusion of our work, both the theoretical part and the practical proof of implementation.

\section{Theoretical Work}
\label{sec:Theoretical Work}

We have developed and discussed the design decisions between a peer to peer encrypted file synchronization software.
Before defining our concept we looked at existing work and academic papers to help us define the features we would like to cover in chapter~\ref{chap:Related and Existing Work}.
In chapter~\ref{chap:concept} we discussed the general scope of the undertaking and defined the concept of this work.
We combined most features users have come to expect from any other available data storage service with features required to retain the security of the users' data into an encompassing concept.
Chapter~\ref{chap:architecture} thus served to define the actual architecture we would implement as a proof of the concept of the basic functionality.
We discussed how we proposed to define the storage space to work for all required use cases and how the peers would communicate between themselves.
We then discussed our implementation of the proof of concept work in chapter~\ref{chap:Implementation}.
We went into detail in how our implementation is structured and how we implemented core aspects of the proposed architecture.
Finally we discuss the finished implementation in chapter~\ref{chap:Results and Recapitulation}.
We explained the current feature state of the implementation in comparison to existing work.
Furthermore an outlook on the multiple possible future improvements and expansions was given.
