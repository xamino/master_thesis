\section*{Abstract}
\label{chap:abstract}

We proposed and implemented an open source, peer to peer, file synchronization software based on the Tox communication protocol.
Targeted features include full secure communication between peers, an encrypted server peer, and a focus on ease of use while retaining data security.
The software suite was implemented based on the Tox protocol, with Golang as the programming language, and the server client built to offer free choice of storage mechanisms, for which we implemented support for the Hadoop distributed file system.
