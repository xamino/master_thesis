\section*{Abstract}
\label{chap:abstract}

We proposed and implemented an open source, peer to peer, file synchronization tool based on the Tox protocol.
Targeted features include full secure communication between peers, optional encrypted peers, a server peer for third party support, and a focus on ease of use.
The software suite was implemented based on the Tox protocol, with Golang as the programming language, and the server client built on top of Hadoop.

TODO: Correct, improve, add.
