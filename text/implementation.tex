\subsection{Tox}
\label{sub:Tox}

I think I will be using this binding for Tox: \url{https://github.com/codedust/go-tox}.
Note: not sure if he has implemented file transfers yet, which I definitely require!
Although I can get started without them for validating the protocol.

\section{Tinzenite Library}

TODO: on the topic of salted hashes: note where the salt is stored etc.

%TODO
TODO: on receiving an update: queue in connection specific command queue (one per connection because only one OP per connection) (update / redo existing fetch if applicable != FIFO); fetch first file in queue.
Then wait a bit (?) before propagating update yourself (decouple receive and send time frames?). <-- Isn't this implementation details?

TODO: add capability for delta updates... if possible. :P
Delta is difficult because we must effectively track parts of files instead of complete files... how to do this?
use librsync! <-- Really good and easy to use, will save a ton of work!

TODO: Also remember that multiple file transfers might be a problem.
Do we limit the connection to one transfer at a time or can we fetch everything at once?

TODO: I need to put some thought into avoiding a conflict between the disk watcher and when Tinzenite updates the objects... :P

TODO: Another feature that might be viable to implemented as an advanced feature is the capability of easily comparing peer IDs via pretty hashes or so.
Since these would be required to be the same on both ends these should probably also be supported by the core library.
