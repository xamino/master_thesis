TODO: on the topic of salted hashes: note where the salt is stored etc.

%TODO
TODO: on receiving an update: queue in connection specific command queue (one per connection because only one OP per connection) (update / redo existing fetch if applicable != FIFO); fetch first file in queue.
Then wait a bit (?) before propagating update yourself (decouple receive and send time frames?). <-- Isn't this implementation details?

TODO: add capability for delta updates... if possible. :P
Delta is difficult because we must effectively track parts of files instead of complete files... how to do this?
use librsync! <-- Really good and easy to use, will save a ton of work!

TODO: Also remember that multiple file transfers might be a problem.
Do we limit the connection to one transfer at a time or can we fetch everything at once?

TODO: I need to put some thought into avoiding a conflict between the disk watcher and when Tinzenite updates the objects... :P
