\chapter{Results and Recapitulation}

%TODO a whole lot

\section{Performance}

TODO: do an informal comparison to previously highlighted comparable software.
Should include hard facts such as speed (internet vs intranet) and limitations.

\section{Usability}

TODO: not sure how to do this, but something akin to this should be here

\section{Security}

TODO: highlight what makes this solution secure, what I did to migitate attack vectors, what risks remain (especially user risks).

\section{Future Work}

TODO: I'm sure you can list a ton of future work to be done by the time you're done.
If you're lucky at least the API won't have to be totally redone.
