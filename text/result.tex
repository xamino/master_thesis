%TODO a whole lot

\section{Performance}

TODO: do an informal comparison to previously highlighted comparable software.
Should include hard facts such as speed (internet vs intranet) and limitations.

\section{Usability}

TODO: not sure how to do this, but something akin to this should be here

\section{Security}

TODO: highlight what makes this solution secure, what I did to migitate attack vectors, what risks remain (especially user risks).

\section{Future Work}

TODO: I'm sure you can list a ton of future work to be done by the time you're done.
If you're lucky at least the API won't have to be totally redone.

One thing I can think of already is that torrents are more efficient because files can be fetched from multiple sources at the same time, hastening the transfer immensely.
Ideally this won't be too bad in my case though because I don't intend Tinzenite to be used with a large enough number of devices for this to make a difference.
