%TODO a whole lot

\section{Basic Goals}

TODO: MUST-, SHOULD-, COULD-have

\section{Dependencies}

TODO: list, explain reasoning, and list interesting features for all software I'll use to build this

\section{API}

TODO: show and explain JSON api I intend to use to facilitate communication between peers.
Note that the API should already be specified for all planned features, independent of how far I actually get!

\section{Software Scope}

TODO: section for listing actual conceptual work I'll have to do before starting implementation

\subsection{Client Peer}

TODO: list and explain features of basic computer client (how to connect peers, how to encrypt), remember that usability is important

\subsection{Server Peer}

TODO: write that basically encrypted peer that can handle multiple accounts, stores data via Hadoop.
Future work could include web client â€“ should I add this here too?

\subsection{Mobile Peer}

TODO: write that App, add shadow file feature
